# But you are & * # @ dressed as one...

You can't expect to wield supreme power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you! You don't vote for kings. Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system! Oh, ow! But you are dressed as one...

I have to push the pram a lot. I have to push the pram a lot. Well, I got better. **Look, my liege!** _Well, how'd you become king, then?_ Why?

## Look, my liege!

I am your king. The Knights Who Say Ni demand a sacrifice! Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.

1.  Oh, ow!
2.  Well, I got better.
3.  It's only a model.

### ...Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate?

Bring her forward! Camelot! You can't expect to wield supreme power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you! We shall say 'Ni' again to you, if you do not appease us. We found them.

-   Shut up! Will you shut up?!
-   Be quiet!
-   We want a shrubbery!!

Where'd you get the coconuts? She looks like one. But you are dressed as one... Why do you think that she is a witch? Shut up!

And this isn't my nose. This is a false one. Look, my liege! Well, I got better. What a strange person.

Camelot! You can't expect to wield supreme power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you! I dunno. Must be a king. I dunno. Must be a king.

We shall say 'Ni' again to you, if you do not appease us. Burn her! I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time!

The nose? Did you dress her up like this? What do you mean? Oh! Come and see the violence inherent in the system! Help, help, I'm being repressed! The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king.

I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time! Well, how'd you become king, then?

What do you mean? We want a shrubbery!! I am your king. He hasn't got shit all over him. Now, look here, my good man.

Where'd you get the coconuts? Be quiet! We want a shrubbery!! I am your king. ...Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate?

Bring her forward! Well, I didn't vote for you. Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system! Why? The nose? I'm not a witch.

What a strange person. We found them. Where'd you get the coconuts? No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she's got a wart. And this isn't my nose. This is a false one. I'm not a witch.

Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni! And this isn't my nose. This is a false one. Well, I didn't vote for you. Bloody Peasant!
